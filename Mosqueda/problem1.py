"""Okay, great.  You found the telemetry file.

As the colonists approach Mars, you need to help them calculate their telemetry data.  
To do this, you are going to
write a python program.  
The program should ask the user if they would like to input either "Miles above Mars" or
"Kilometers above Mars". 
 If they choose "Miles above Mars", the program should then prompt them to enter the number
of miles. 
 Then the program should display the number of yards, feet, and inches that are in that many miles.
If the user chooses "Kilometers above Mars", the program should 
then prompt them to enter the number of kilometers.
Then the program should display the number of meters, centimeters, 
and millimeters that are in that many kilometers.

Once you solve this problem, proceed to find the resource file in the file system."""
